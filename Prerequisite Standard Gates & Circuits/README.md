# Prerequisite Standard Gates & Circuits
### 1. <ins>AND Gate:</ins> 
An AND gate outputs high only when all its inputs are high. In 45nm CMOS, it benefits from low power and fast switching, serving as a fundamental building block in digital logic circuits.

### 2. <ins>Inverter: </ins> 
The inverter (NOT gate) outputs the logical complement of its input signal. It is the simplest CMOS gate, widely used for signal restoration and phase inversion with minimal delay and power.

### 3. <ins>NOR Gate: </ins>
A NOR gate outputs high only when all its inputs are low. It is a universal gate in CMOS design, commonly used in control logic and memory circuits for robust operation at scaled voltages and fast response.

### 4. <ins>D Flip-Flop with Reset: </ins>
A D Flip-Flop captures input data on the clock edge and includes a reset to clear the output. It enables reliable state storage and initialization in sequential digital systems, ensuring robust high-speed performance.

### 5. <ins>TSPC D Flip-Flop: </ins>
A TSPC (True Single Phase Clock) D Flip-Flop is a high-speed, dynamic flip-flop that uses only a single clock phase for operation. TSPC DFFs offer reduced transistor count, low propagation delay, and low power consumptionâ€”making them ideal for high-performance VLSI systems.
