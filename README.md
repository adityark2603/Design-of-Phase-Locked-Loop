### <ins> Role of PFD in PLL: </ins>
1. The PFD operates by receiving two input signals (reference and divider outputs), and its output transitions help detect both phase and frequency differences.​
2. Digital D-type flip-flops (DFFs) are used in a typical PFD implementation, for robust operation under low voltage (1.0–1.2V) and high-speed switching in the 45nm process node.
