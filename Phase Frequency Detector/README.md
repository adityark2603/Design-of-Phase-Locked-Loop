# Phase Frequency Detector
A Phase Frequency Detector (PFD) is a crucial building block in Phase Locked Loop (PLL) circuits, especially in digital and mixed-signal design flows for advanced technology nodes such as 45nm. The PFD compares the phase and frequency of the reference and feedback signals, generating UP and DOWN signals to control the Charge Pump and subsequently the Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO).

### <ins>Key Features:</ins>
- **Low supply voltage compatibility**: Operation at 1.0–1.2V is typical for 45nm CMOS technology, reducing power consumption.
- **High-speed response**: The reduced feature size allows fast edge detection, leading to more accurate phase comparison and enabling higher frequency applications.
- **Digital robustness**: The PFD’s digital core is less affected by process variations and mismatch, which become significant at 45nm.
