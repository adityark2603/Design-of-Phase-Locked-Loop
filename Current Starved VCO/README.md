# Current Starved VCO
A Current Starved Voltage Controlled Oscillator (CSVCO) is a common and relatively simple type of VCO used in Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) circuits, particularly in digital-heavy or mixed-signal designs at advanced technology nodes like $\mathbf{45nm}$.

### <ins>Key Features:</ins>
  - Enables a large frequency spread to compensate for significant PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature) variations inherent at $\mathbf{45nm}$.
  - Power consumption is directly controlled and limited by the starved current $\left(I_{starved}\right)$, making it ideal for low-voltage ($1.0-1.2V$) mobile and SoC applications.
